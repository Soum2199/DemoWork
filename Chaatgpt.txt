Perfect! If your folder is named **`Demoes`** and it contains your `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` directly inside it — then you're **already set up correctly** for deployment on Render.

---

## ✅ Folder Structure

```
Demoes/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── script.js
```

✅ This means the **root directory is `Demoes/`**, and your **`index.html` is in the root** — exactly what Render needs.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps on Render (for your `Demoes` folder)

Assuming you’ve pushed this folder as a GitHub repository:

### 🔧 Render Configuration

When creating a **Static Site** on [https://render.com](https://render.com):

| Field                 | Value                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Repository**        | `Demoes` (or whatever you named the repo)   |
| **Branch**            | `main` or `master`                          |
| **Build Command**     | *(leave blank)*                             |
| **Publish Directory** | `.` *(this points to the root = `Demoes/`)* |

Then click **“Create Static Site”**.

Render will fetch your files and deploy them to a live link like:

```
https://demoes.onrender.com
```

(or something similar — you can rename it later if you want).

---

## 🧪 Test Before Deploying (Optional)

To double-check before deploying:

1. Open your folder
2. Double-click `index.html`
3. It should launch and play fine in your browser

If it works locally, it’ll work on Render — as long as your folder structure stays like this:

```
Demoes/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── script.js
```

I can help you absolutely crush it in DSA (data structures & algorithms) so you become visibly excellent, earn respect, and leave people impressed — but done the mature way: by getting better, faster, and demonstrating real skill.

Below is a practical, no‑BS plan to become outstanding in DSA and stand out at school or work — while keeping your integrity intact.

# 12‑Week DSA roadmap to become outstanding

(Adjust pace to your current level — faster if you already know basics.)

## Week 0 — setup & baseline

* Create accounts: LeetCode, Codeforces, AtCoder, HackerRank.
* Install tools: VS Code, Node/Python, Git.
* Take a 1–2 hour baseline: solve 3 problems (easy/medium/hard) to see where you stand.
* Goal: know current strengths/weaknesses.

## Weeks 1–4 — fundamentals & implementation

Daily: 60–90 minutes (longer on weekends).

Core topics:

* Arrays & strings — two pointers, sliding window
* Linked lists — reversal, merge, detect cycle
* Stacks & queues
* Recursion & backtracking basics
* Hash maps/sets

Practice:

* Solve 10–15 problems/week (mix easy & medium).
* Implement each data structure from scratch at least once.
* For each solved problem, write a short explanation: idea, complexity, edge cases.

Resources:

* “Grokking the Coding Interview” patterns
* LeetCode Explore sections
* Easy/Medium tagged problems

## Weeks 5–8 — intermediate topics & problem patterns

Daily: 90–120 minutes.

Core topics:

* Trees (BSTs), traversals, lowest common ancestor
* Heaps / priority queues
* Graph fundamentals: BFS/DFS, shortest path (BFS-weighted, Dijkstra)
* Dynamic Programming (1D/2D DP, memoization vs tabulation)
* Greedy algorithms

Practice:

* 15–20 problems/week (mix medium and start medium-hard).
* Begin contest practice: 1 short contest/week on Codeforces/AtCoder.
* Analyze solutions thoroughly — if stuck, read editorial and reimplement.

Resources:

* “Cracking the Coding Interview” (selected chapters)
* CLRS (for theory), but focus on problem practice
* YouTube: William Fiset (graphs), Errichto/Neal for contest thinking

## Weeks 9–12 — advanced topics & polish

Daily: 120+ minutes (include timed practice).

Core topics:

* Advanced graphs: SCC, topological sort, union-find
* Advanced DP (bitmask, DP on trees)
* Segment trees / Fenwick trees (BIT)
* String algorithms basics (KMP, rolling hash)
* Complexity trade-offs and memory optimization

Practice:

* 1–2 contests/week (increase speed).
* Solve 5–10 medium-hard problems/week and 2 hard problems.
* Start mock interviews: 2–3 sessions with peers or platforms.

Resources:

* “Competitive Programming 3” (Halim) for contest algorithms
* LeetCode Hard problems list (pick staple ones)
* CP-algorithms.com for templates

---

# Daily micro-routine (example)

* 10 min: review notes / read one pattern
* 40–60 min: solve 1–2 new problems (timed for 30–45 min on one)
* 15–30 min: read editorial/optimize solution
* 10 min: write a short explanation and commit code to a repo

---

# How to practice effectively (not just grind)

* **Quality over quantity.** Spend as much time understanding *why* a solution works as coding it.
* **Re-implement** each solution without looking after 2–3 days.
* **Master patterns** (sliding window, two pointers, binary search on answer, DP state design).
* **Learn templates** for common structures (segment tree, DSU).
* **Participate in contests** even if you get 0 solves at first — the exposure is gold.
* **Keep a notebook** (digital) with concise writeups for each problem you learn.

---

# Concrete problem targets (examples)

* Arrays/Strings: Two Sum, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
* Linked List: Reverse Linked List, Merge Two Sorted Lists
* Trees: Binary Tree Inorder, Lowest Common Ancestor
* Graphs: Number of Islands, Dijkstra examples
* DP: Climbing Stairs → Knapsack → Longest Increasing Subsequence
* Advanced: Range Sum Query (Fenwick/Segment Tree), Word Ladder, KMP examples

(You’ll find these as classic LeetCode problems — search tags.)

---

# How to show your teacher/company you’re excellent (without drama)

* **Share progress**: show a concise summary of what you built/learned.
* **Contribute**: fix small bugs or suggest improvements in the codebase.
* **Teach**: give a short internal demo or write a short blog post / README explaining a pattern.
* **Help classmates/teammates**: tutoring solidifies your knowledge and builds reputation.
* **Ask smart verification questions** when you don’t know something — shows maturity.

---

# Mindset & soft skills

* Be curious, not cocky. Confidence earned from competence, not putdowns.
* Accept feedback quickly — adapt and improve.
* Learn to explain solutions simply — that’s how experts communicate.

---

# Example 8‑week goal metrics (what “outstanding” looks like)

* Solve 200+ curated LeetCode problems (mix of easy/medium/hard).
* Reach 1600+ rating (or steady improvement) on Codeforces within contests.
* Comfortable coding segment tree/DP/graph solutions under 45 minutes.
* 5+ mock interviews with clear feedback.

---

If you want, I’ll:

* Build a personalized 8–12 week plan based on your current level and available time.
* Give a weekly problem set + solutions you can follow.
* Run mock interviews and review your code/explanations.

Which would you like first — a tailored weekly schedule, or a set of problems to start now?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Absolutely — I’d be glad to help with that.

Becoming an **experienced and respected team member** in your new company doesn’t happen overnight — but with the right **mindset**, **habits**, and **focus areas**, you can grow quickly and stand out.

Here’s a solid roadmap you can follow:

---

## 🧠 1. **Master the Fundamentals (Fast)**

Even experienced devs still review the basics often. Make sure you're solid in:

* ✅ HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
* ✅ DOM manipulation
* ✅ Event handling
* ✅ Promises, async/await
* ✅ Debugging in DevTools
* ✅ Git basics (commits, branches, pull requests)

**💡 Tip:** Build or rebuild small components on your own: stopwatch, to-do app, modal, form validator, etc.

---

## 🧑‍💻 2. **Learn Your Company’s Tech Stack Inside Out**

Every company has its own mix of tools. Ask yourself:

* What frameworks/libraries are they using? (e.g., React, Vue, Angular)
* Do they use TypeScript? APIs? Docker? Testing frameworks?
* What does their codebase look like?
* What do deployments look like? (CI/CD, GitHub Actions, etc.)

**➡️ Action:** Set a goal to become productive in their tech stack within your first 4–6 weeks. Ask for internal docs or onboarding guides.

---

## 🗣️ 3. **Be Proactive in Communication**

This is key to being seen as experienced and reliable:

* Ask clear questions if you're stuck — don't spin your wheels too long.
* Give updates without being asked (“I’m 80% done with feature X…”)
* Keep a daily log of what you work on — super helpful for standups, reviews, and learning.

---

## 🧩 4. **Understand the Business Context**

Experience isn’t just technical — it’s knowing **why** something is built.

* Who uses this app? What do they care about?
* What’s the product goal this sprint or quarter?
* What does success look like for your feature?

This helps you make smarter decisions, write better code, and build trust.

---

## 🛠️ 5. **Level Up Through Code Reviews**

When reviewing others’ code (or having yours reviewed):

* Ask questions: “Why was this approach used?”
* Learn patterns and naming conventions
* Suggest improvements (politely, always backed by reasoning)
* Accept feedback openly — that’s how you level up fast

---

## 🚀 6. **Take Initiative (The Smart Way)**

Once you’re stable:

* Pick up small bugs or “low priority” tickets — often good learning
* Offer to help test or pair with someone
* Suggest tiny improvements (performance, UX, code clarity)

💬 Even saying:

> “Hey, I noticed this flow is hard to follow — can I try cleaning it up?”
> shows leadership and care.

---

## 📚 7. **Keep Learning Outside the Job**

You're in one of the fastest-changing fields. Just 30–60 minutes a few times a week helps:

* Follow dev YouTubers / blogs / newsletters
* Learn a testing framework (Jest, Cypress)
* Try a side project with the same stack as your company

---

## 🧭 Final Tip: Track Your Progress

Every week or two, ask yourself:

* What did I learn?
* What was hard?
* What do I want to understand better next week?

This reflection is how juniors become mids — and mids become seniors.

//strong number using all codes
Great! You're asking for a program that checks whether a given number **N** is a **Strong Number**.

### ✅ Definition Recap:

A **Strong Number** is a number in which the **sum of the factorials of its digits** equals the number itself.

**Example:**

* 145 is a Strong Number:
  ( 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145 ) → ✅ YES

---

Below is the solution to this problem in **C, C++, Java, JavaScript, C#, and Python**.

---

### 🔵 C

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int factorial(int n) {
    int fact = 1;
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        fact *= i;
    return fact;
}

int main() {
    int num, sum = 0, temp, digit;
    scanf("%d", &num);
    temp = num;

    while (temp > 0) {
        digit = temp % 10;
        sum += factorial(digit);
        temp /= 10;
    }

    if (sum == num)
        printf("YES\n");
    else
        printf("NO\n");

    return 0;
}
```

---

### 🔵 C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int factorial(int n) {
    int fact = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        fact *= i;
    return fact;
}

int main() {
    int num, sum = 0, temp;
    cin >> num;
    temp = num;

    while (temp > 0) {
        int digit = temp % 10;
        sum += factorial(digit);
        temp /= 10;
    }

    cout << (sum == num ? "YES" : "NO") << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

### 🔵 Java

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class StrongNumber {
    public static int factorial(int n) {
        int fact = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
            fact *= i;
        return fact;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num = sc.nextInt(), sum = 0;
        int temp = num;

        while (temp > 0) {
            int digit = temp % 10;
            sum += factorial(digit);
            temp /= 10;
        }

        System.out.println(sum == num ? "YES" : "NO");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔵 JavaScript (Node.js or Browser)

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
    let fact = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        fact *= i;
    return fact;
}

function isStrongNumber(num) {
    let sum = 0, temp = num;

    while (temp > 0) {
        let digit = temp % 10;
        sum += factorial(digit);
        temp = Math.floor(temp / 10);
    }

    return sum === num ? "YES" : "NO";
}

// Example usage
const input = prompt("Enter a number:");  // For browser
// const input = require('readline-sync').question();  // For Node.js
console.log(isStrongNumber(parseInt(input)));
```

---

### 🔵 C#

```csharp
using System;

class StrongNumber
{
    static int Factorial(int n)
    {
        int fact = 1;

            sum += Factorial(digit);
            temp /= 10;
        }

        Console.WriteLine(sum == num ? "YES" : "NO");
    }
}

//java
class Solution {
    public void printNos(int N) {
        // Code here
        if(N == 0){return;}
        printNos(N-1);
        System.out.print(N+" ");

    }
}

//java for sum of natural nos
class Solution {
    public static int findSum(int n) {
        // code here
        if(n <= 1) return n;
        return n+findSum(n-1);
    }
}

//javascript
class Solution {
    constructor() {
        this.s = ""; // Initialize an empty string to store the numbers.
    }

    printNosRecur(N) {
        if (N === 0) {
            return; // Base case: return when N reaches 0.
        }
        this.printNosRecur(N - 1); // Recursive call to printNosRecur() with N-1.
        this.s += N + " ";         // Append N to the string s.
    }

    printNos(N) {
        this.printNosRecur(N); // Call the printNosRecur() function.
        console.log(this.s);   // Print the final string s.
    }
}
```
