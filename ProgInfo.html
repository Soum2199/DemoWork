      <p><b>Python</b>, but it has several disadvantages.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>If you’re a hobbyist and just want to learn programming, Python will probably be fine</li>
       <li>If you’re a CompSci or Software Engineering student, you’ll want something else</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you’re a hobbyist and just want to learn programming for your own amusement, Python’s certainly the easiest language to learn. You can do a great deal with just a few lines of code.
<br />
You won’t even notice Python’s weaknesses. Have fun.
<br />
If you’re an aspiring Software Engineer or Game Programmer, you should start elsewhere. Starting with Python will hamper you.
<br />
Without getting too down into the weeds, object-oriented (OO) programming is everywhere. Even if you don’t like it, you’ll need to know it eventually. You should learn it in your larval years as a CompSci student.
<br />
That being said, you should learn Java or C# first. They’re not that hard. They’re solid OO languages that incorporate and embrace OO to their very cores.
<br />
Python fans say that Python is OO. It’s not. Python has some OO tacked-on. And its syntax is something of its own making. It bears some similarity to existing languages, but it takes some left turns that leave many scratching their heads.

I don’t want to knock Python. Python is a great language for some things. It’s not what you want to base your CompSci learning on.
<br />
So learn Java or C# and while you do, learn computer science fundamentals.

As a software engineer, it’s rare that you’ll learn just one language. You’ll eventually need to know several. It’s okay; it doesn’t hurt.
<br />
If you’re an aspiring game programmer, you’ll eventually need to know C++. And in that case, you’ll want to learn C# first. Then the transition from C# to C++ is fairly painless.

Why not start with C++? Because it doesn’t enforce OO, it just allows it. You can end up writing some real ***** code in C++ thinking you’re doing OO, and you’re not.

So do yourself a favor and as an aspiring game programmer, learn C# first. You can even make some professional grade game engines with it, without ever needing to touch C++ if you like.

      <p>I am 45. I was laid off last year due to downsizing and had 4 serious job offers to consider within the first 3 weeks (including the week of vacation I took before starting the hunt.)

The thing is, you have to work to keep yourself marketable. Technology changes rapidly and you have to keep up. You can't work as a software engineer for 10–15 years in the same technology stack and then expect to easily find a new job based on that same technology you started with. While such jobs may still exist, they will typically be few and far between, and they're usually maintenance jobs that don't demand top dollar.

There will of course be some challenges. Getting your foot in the door at a startup being run by a 21-year old and his college buddies may be a tough sell for somebody twice their age. And the pace of startup development could be too much for somebody with a family. But established companies with competent recruiters and seasoned managers understand the value of maturity and experience when it is combined with flexibility and adaptability, so as long as you can keep up with the technology landscape, you will always be able to find a job.</p>

      </p>
      <br />
      <ol>
    <li>Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that no longer serves you or makes you happy.</li>
    <li>Do not lower your standards for anyone or anything.</li>
    <li>Self-respect has to be stronger than your feelings.</li>
    <li>Respect yourself enough to let go of someone who does not see your worth. Refuse to be disrespected.</li>
    <li>Openly communicate about things that are important to you.</li>
    <li>Say "no" to things, people, and situations that are not in alignment with you. Always respect your own choices.</li>
    <li>Maintain the promises you have made yourself.</li>
    <li>Never chase love or admiration - first, give it to yourself.</li>
