First, the user asked for "demo student data using excel for data analyst practice." This seems like a request for sample data in Excel format, probably for practicing data analysis.


## Interpreting user request  
- The user asked for "demo student data using Excel for data analyst practice."  
- This likely means they need sample student data in Excel format for practicing data analysis skills.
</think>### Sample Student Data Overview
This is fictional demo data for practicing data analysis in Excel. It includes 20 students with fields like Name, Age, Grade Level, Subject, Score (out of 100), and Attendance (%). You can copy-paste this into Excel: Select the table below, paste into a new sheet, and use Excel's features (e.g., filters, pivot tables, charts) to analyze trends like average scores by grade or subject performance.

### Practice Ideas
- **Basic Analysis**: Calculate averages (e.g., mean score by subject using AVERAGEIF).
- **Visualizations**: Create a bar chart of scores by grade level or a scatter plot of score vs. attendance.
- **Advanced**: Use pivot tables to summarize data (e.g., total scores per subject) or conditional formatting to highlight low attendance.
- **Expansion**: Add more rows or columns (e.g., Gender, School Year) to practice larger datasets.

Perfect 👍 — here’s the **complete breakdown** of everything a Python `list` object has, including both its **own methods** and the **inherited ones** from the base `object` class, along with short explanations.

## 🧩 1. List-Specific (Public) Methods

These are the everyday methods you’ll actually use:

| Method                             | Description                                                           |
| :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `append(x)`                        | Add an item `x` to the end of the list.                               |
| `extend(iterable)`                 | Add all items from another iterable (list, tuple, etc.) to the end.   |
| `insert(i, x)`                     | Insert item `x` at position `i`.                                      |
| `remove(x)`                        | Remove the first occurrence of `x`. Raises `ValueError` if not found. |
| `pop([i])`                         | Remove and return item at index `i` (default: last item).             |
| `clear()`                          | Remove all items (empty the list).                                    |
| `index(x[, start[, end]])`         | Return the index of the first occurrence of `x`.                      |
| `count(x)`                         | Return how many times `x` appears.                                    |
| `sort(*, key=None, reverse=False)` | Sort the list in place.                                               |
| `reverse()`                        | Reverse the list in place.                                            |
| `copy()`                           | Return a shallow copy of the list.                                    |

## ⚙️ 2. Special (Dunder) Methods

These are used internally or for operator overloading.

| Method                                                     | Description                                                    |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `__add__(self, other)`                                     | Enables `+` operator to concatenate lists.                     |
| `__iadd__(self, other)`                                    | Enables `+=` operator for extending lists.                     |
| `__mul__(self, n)`                                         | Enables `*` operator for repetition.                           |
| `__rmul__(self, n)`                                        | Enables right-side repetition (`n * list`).                    |
| `__imul__(self, n)`                                        | Enables in-place multiplication (`list *= n`).                 |
| `__getitem__(self, index)`                                 | Access item(s) via indexing or slicing.                        |
| `__setitem__(self, index, value)`                          | Assign to item(s) via indexing or slicing.                     |
| `__delitem__(self, index)`                                 | Delete item(s) via indexing or slicing.                        |
| `__contains__(self, item)`                                 | Enables `in` operator.                                         |
| `__len__(self)`                                            | Enables `len(list)`.                                           |
| `__iter__(self)`                                           | Returns an iterator for looping (`for x in list`).             |
| `__reversed__(self)`                                       | Called by `reversed(list)`.                                    |
| `__eq__`, `__ne__`, `__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__` | Comparison operators.                                          |
| `__repr__(self)`                                           | Official string representation, e.g. `[1, 2, 3]`.              |
| `__str__(self)`                                            | Informal string representation (same as `__repr__` for lists). |
| `__hash__(self)`                                           | Lists are *not hashable* — this is disabled.                   |
| `__sizeof__(self)`                                         | Returns memory size of the list object.                        |

## 🧠 3. Inherited from `object`

Every Python class inherits these:

| Method / Attribute                 | Description                                         |
| :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `__class__`                        | The class the object belongs to (`<class 'list'>`). |
| `__init__(self, iterable=())`      | Constructor; initializes list from iterable.        |
| `__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)`    | Creates a new instance (before `__init__`).         |
| `__getattribute__(self, name)`     | Called when an attribute is accessed.               |
| `__setattr__(self, name, value)`   | Called when setting an attribute.                   |
| `__delattr__(self, name)`          | Called when deleting an attribute.                  |
| `__dir__(self)`                    | Returns list of valid attributes for `dir(obj)`.    |
| `__doc__`                          | The docstring of the class.                         |
| `__format__(self, format_spec)`    | Called by `format(obj, spec)`.                      |
| `__reduce__`, `__reduce_ex__`      | Used by `pickle` for object serialization.          |
| `__init_subclass__(cls, **kwargs)` | Called when subclassing `list`.                     |
| `__subclasshook__(cls, subclass)`  | Determines if a class is considered a subclass.     |

---

## ✅ Quick way to view them in Python:

```python
>>> dir(list)
# or for a specific list instance:
>>> dir([])
```

If you only want **user-facing (non-dunder)** methods:

```python
[m for m in dir(list) if not m.startswith('__')]
```

Output:

```python
['append', 'clear', 'copy', 'count', 'extend', 'index', 'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']
```

Would you like me to show which of these methods come from `list` vs inherited from `object` programmatically (using `list.__dict__`)?
