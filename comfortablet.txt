The choice between Goldman Sachs and Walmart for a data scientist/analyst role depends heavily on your career goals, desired industry, and work-life balance preferences. 
Goldman Sachs • Pros: 

	• Prestige and Brand: Goldman Sachs is a top-tier global investment bank, offering significant brand value that can boost a resume. 
	• Compensation: Generally offers very competitive salaries and large potential bonuses, often higher than other companies, especially in front-end roles. 
	• Impactful Projects: Data analysts/scientists work on high-impact projects that influence global markets, such as quantitative research and algorithmic trading. 
	• Talented Colleagues: Employees often mention working with smart, ambitious, and driven colleagues. 

• Cons: 

	• Work-Life Balance: The finance industry is known for demanding hours and an intense work culture, which can lead to burnout. 
	• Role Variation: Some "back-end" or non-core tech roles might involve more mundane tasks with less learning potential, despite good pay. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  

Walmart • Pros: 

	• Tech Focus: Walmart Global Tech (formerly Walmart Labs) is a significant technology division working on large-scale retail and e-commerce challenges, which can be stimulating for a technologist. 
	• Work-Life Balance: While review snippets show some work-life balance concerns, generally the retail tech sector may offer better hours than investment banking. 
	• Competitive Salary in Tech: For specific tech roles (like SDE 3 or Senior Data Scientist), Walmart can be quite competitive with its compensation packages, including base, stock, and bonus. 
	• Scale: Working at a retail giant involves massive datasets and complex supply chain, pricing, and customer behavior problems, offering a different kind of scale and impact compared to finance. 

• Cons: 

	• Perception: While Walmart Global Tech is a strong tech company, the overall "Walmart" brand does not carry the same immediate prestige as "Goldman Sachs" in the general market. 
	• Culture Issues: Some employee reviews mention political work environments and toxic management in specific teams, though overall data scientist ratings are good. [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Recommendation:
